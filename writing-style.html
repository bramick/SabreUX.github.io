  <!-- Abbreviations
  ================================================== -->          
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="abbreviations" class="page-header">Abbreviations and acronyms</h1>
    <h3>Abbreviations</h3>
    <p>An abbreviation is a shortened or contracted form of a word or phrase that represents the whole, as in Mon. for Monday, Dr. for doctor, and NCAA for National Collegiate Athletic Association. You do not pronounce an abbreviation by its shortened word form.</p>  
    <div class="well well-sm">
      <p><strong>API</strong> application programming interface</p>
      <p><strong>mph</strong> miles per hour</p>
      <p><strong>MB/s</strong> megabytes per second</p>
    </div>
    <p>Use periods when abbreviating U.S. for United States within text (n headlines, do not use periods). </p>
    <p>Use all caps, but no periods, in longer abbreviations when individual letters are pronounced, such as GDS. Unless a common phrase or proper name, such as FBI, spell out phrase and put abbreviation in parentheses for first reference.</p>
    <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Note &mdash;</strong> Do not refer to our products or services with abbreviations, e.g., Sabe Dev Studio as "SDS." Use the full name; or after the first use, "Dev Studio". Read more about styling our company <a href="#names_and_terms">names and terms</a>.</p>
    <h3>Acronyms</h3>
    <p>An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters in a set of words; acronyms often are all caps, and you pronounce the word form as a separate word. In our communications, never substitute an acronym for <em>Sabre</em> names or terms.</p>
    <div class="well well-sm">
      <p><strong>ROM</strong> read-only memory</p>
      <p><strong>WAC</strong> Women's Army Corps</p>
      <p><strong>OPEC</strong> Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</p>

  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="headings" class="page-header">Headings and headlines</h1>
    <!-- <p>Start headings with a verb. Headings can be nouns for reference information (such as "API disclaimer" and "FAQs") and for these documentation sections (API suitability, method and endpoint, request, response, examples, sample workflow, usage notes, error codes)</p> -->
    <p>Capitalize only the first word and pronouns.</p>
    <p>For SEO reasons, ensure you've used keywords and theme words in headings h1, h2, and h3, and in the first few words of your first paragraph.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lists
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="lists" class="page-header">Lists</h1>  
    <p>Lists are best introduced by a complete grammatical sentence, followed by a colon (except in the cases shown below). If introducing a list with a fragment, omit the colon (&#58;).</p>
    <p>All list items should be alike&mdash;all should be noun forms, phrases, full sentences, or whatever the context.</p>
    <p>List items carry no closing punctuation unless they consist of complete sentences. Start list items with a capital letter.</p>
    <div class="well well-sm">

  <!-- Names and terms
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="names_and_terms" class="page-header">Names and terms</h1>
    <p><strong>Company and overall <em>Sabre Red</em> names</strong>. First use of these names (other than headlines, subheads, titles and images), such as <em>Sabre&reg;</em>, <em>Sabre Travel Network&reg;</em> and the <em>Sabre&reg; Red&trade;</em> travel solution, should use capitalization, italics and registration symbols. Subsequent use of names may omit symbols but should still retain the “<em>Sabre</em>” descriptor and full name, capitalization and italics. These names should never hold a possessive mark.</p>
    <p><strong>Product and capability names</strong>. First use (other than headlines, subheads and titles) should have names appear exactly as listed in our naming guide, including capitalization, italics and registration symbols. 
  Subsequent use may omit symbols and the “<em>Sabre</em>” descriptor. It should still retain the rest of its full name, capitalization and italics. For example, first use is <em>Sabre&reg; Traveler Security</em>. Subsequent use is <em>Traveler Security</em>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Sabre Red</em> brand treatments </strong>. First use (other than headlines, subheads and titles) should be <em>Sabre&reg; Red&trade;</em> travel solution, <em>Sabre&reg; Red&trade; Workspace</em>, <em>Sabre&reg; Red&trade; App Centre</em>, and <em>Sabre&reg; Red&trade; Apps</em>. Subsequent use may omit the “<em>Sabre</em>” descriptor and marks, but still retain the “<em>Red</em>” descriptor. For example, first use is <em>Sabre&reg; Red&trade; App Centre</em>. Subsequent use is <em>Red App Centre</em>.</p>
    <p><em>Sabre Dev Studio</em> is never abbreviated. After first use, you may drop the <em>Sabre</em> and use <em>Dev Studio</em> for the remainder of the webpage content.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">Do not use italics or symbols in headlines, subheads, titles, or images.</div>
      <p><strong>First use of names</strong>. Treat each webpage like a new chapter &mdash; follow the guidelines for first-use per page.</p>
      <p><strong>Web</strong>. The Web is the Internet's most used service. 
        <ul>
          <li>If used as an adjective and standing alone, capitalize Web. Also capitalize Internet.</li>
          <li>Do not capitalize Web if used in a compound word. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    <div class="well well-sm">
      <p>Web, Web feed, and Web page</p>
      <p>webcam, webcast, webmaster, webinar, and website</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Web page URLs</strong>. Used in instructional or reference content, display the full URL <em>www.urlinfo.com/</em> if necessary for context. Drop the <em>www</em> in informative content. </p>
    <p><strong>E-<em>word</em></strong>. Hyphenate words like e-business, e-catalog, and e-commerce. Do not hyphenate conventional terms like email.</p>
  <!-- <h3>Dev Studio terms.</h3>
    <p>Use these terms consistently in <em>Sabre Dev Studio</em> (do not introduce unnecessary synonyms that will confuse users):
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supplemental API</strong>. Do not use <em>helper</em> API. Indicate if an API is supplemental when summarizing or describing an API. </li>
        <li><strong>The Sandbox</strong>. A certification environment that receives API requests.</li>
        <li><strong>The API Explorer</strong>. An interactive tool (living as a GUI) that also points to the CERT environment. Also called I/O Docs in other sites.</li>

        <li><strong>Request API access</strong>. User requests test credentials and Oauth token (this is C2).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Prohibited terms</h4>
    <p>Avoid and omit these terms from your <em>Dev Studio</em> text to ensure you comply with our legal standards:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Market</strong>. Do not use <em>market</em> as a noun (e.g., "the API retrieves markets..."); instead, use <a href="/resources/glossary#city_pair"><em>city pair</em></a> and link the term to the glossary.</p>
          <div class="alert alert-info">"City pair" is a common term, so avoid defining it in your text. Link common terms to the glossary to reduce confusion and content errors.</p>
          <p><strong>Weak</strong> "The API retrieves an origination and destination location."</p>
          <p><strong>Strong</strong> "The API retrieves a <a href="/resources/glossary#city_pair">city pair</a>."</p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p> -->
  </div>

  <!-- Numbers
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="numbers" class="page-header">Numbers</h1>
    <p>Spell out numbers when
      <ul>
        <li>using zero through nine, unless the number is part of a measurement or approved standard (e.g., four bottles, 3 lb.)</li>
        <li>starting a sentence with a number (e.g., "Twenty years ago, we moved to Texas").</li>
        <li>expressing the zeros in million, billion, etc., following a numeral (e.g., 1 billion APIs...)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Use numerals when
      <ul>
        <li>displaying numbers 10 through 999,999</li>
        <li>expressing a part of a measurement (e.g., 88 mph)</li>
        <li>referencing an approved standard (e.g., layer 6 of ISO reference...)</li>
        <li>expressing age; use hyphens when number is an adjective (e.g., Sue is 5 years old; She's a 5-year-old kid).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Percentages</strong>. For web content, use numeral with the percent symbol (e.g., 3%).</p>
    <p><strong>Commas</strong>. After the number 1,000, place commas between groups of three digits, starting from the right (e.g., 2,445,332).</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Dates and times
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="dates_and_times" class="page-header">Dates and times</h1>
    <p>Years are expressed in numerals unless they begin a sentence.</p>
    <p><strong>Format</strong>. Avoid all-numeric dates (incorrect date: 10/05/2000). Spell out or abbreviate the month.
      <ul>
        <li>do not use ordinals in dates &mdash; 15th April or April 15th is incorrect.</li>
        <li><strong>15 April 2000</strong> for instructional, reference, or back-end content that reaches international audiences.</li>
        <li><strong>April 15, 2000</strong> for all content types, and content intended for American audiences. In text, add a comma or period after the year.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Use a hyphen in date adjectives (e.g., a three- to five-year plan...).</p>
    <p>Use an en dash (&ndash;) between ranges of numbers (e.g., April 15&ndash;17). Read about the <a href="#">en dash.</a></p>
    <p><strong>Time</strong>. Use numerals except for noon and midnight (e.g., 8 a.m., noon, 14:00, 5:30 p.m.).
      <ul>
        <li><strong>12-hour or 24-hour format</strong>. Use the format best suited for context. If using 12-hour format, follow the hour numeral with a space then <em>a.m.</em> or <em>p.m.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Time + units</strong>. After the numeral, spell out units of time (e.g., 50 hours, 23 minutes)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Time zones</strong>. Use zone name without reference to daylight savings or standing time (e.g., Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, etc.)</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Punctuation
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="punctuation" class="page-header">Punctuation</h1>
  <!-- 
    <h2>Comma</h2>
    <p><strong>Use with conjunctions</strong>. For instructional and reference content, use the oxford comma. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last. </p>
      <div class="well well-sm">
        red, white, and blue<br>
        honest, energetic, but headstrong<br>
        He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.
      </div>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">This rule differs from our other branded content, which follows the AP Stylebook, and omits the conjunctive comma.</div>
    -->
    <h2>Apostrophe (&#39;)</h2>
    <p><strong>Plurals and possessives</strong>. Form the possessive singular of nouns with 's. Follow this rule whatever the final consonant.</p>
      <div class="well well-sm">
        Charles's friend<br>
        Burns's poems<br>
        the witch's malice
      </div>
    <h2>Em dash (&mdash;)</h2>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>. The most versatile of dashes. Use an em dash to amplify or explain, to separate a subject (or series of subjects) from a pronoun, to indicate a sudden break, and much more.
      <ul>
        <li>Add spaces before or after the em dash &mdash; this rule complies with the AP Stylebook).</li>
        <li>Sentences can contain up to two em dashes.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>En dash (&ndash;)</h2>
    <p><strong>Usage</strong>. Used between two numbers, and means <em>up to and including</em> or <em>through</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>place an en dash between ranges of numbers, with spaces on both sides of it (e.g., 2000 &ndash; 2012).</li>
        <li>omit the en dash if you write <em>from, to, between</em> within the number range (e.g., from 45 to 90). This option is less precise.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Hyphen (-)</h2>
      <p>Use hyphens in less common modified terms, like e-business, e-catalog and e-commerce.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Content elements
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="content_page_elements" class="page-header">Content and page elements</h1>
    <p><strong>Headline</strong>. Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns. No periods. Start with present-tense verb. Do not use italics or symbols in headlines, subheads, titles or images.</p>
    <p><strong>Subhead</strong>. Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns. Can be a statement or question. Pull users in, and connect point to the headline. Do not use italics or symbols.</p>
    <p><strong>Body text</strong>. Use <em>we</em> and <em>our</em> Headings within body text vary&mdash;see templates below.</p>
    <p><strong>First use of names</strong>. Treat each webpage like a new chapter&mdash;follow the guidelines for first-use per page.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- SEO
  ================================================== -->
  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <h1 id="seo" class="page-header">Search engine optimization</h1>
    <p>Include one key word or phrase per page, and mentioned in most or all of these elements:
    <ul>
      <li>Page title</li>
      <li>Major <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> headings</li>
      <li>The words that appear early in titles, and near the beginnings of the top five paragraphs of text</li>
      <li>The alternate (“alt”) text of all content images</li>
      <li>The <meta> tags (if any) in the header section of the page html code</li>
      <li>The words in the html file name, separated with hyphens: “files-names-also-matter.html”</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    <h2>Page titles</h2>
    <p>The page title becomes the page's primary descriptor, so page titles should 
      <ul>
        <li>contain carefully chosen keywords and themes for the page</li>
        <li>form a concise, plainly worded description of the page contents</li>
        <li>be unique, if possible</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Page title also becomes the bookmark text, and some browsers truncate long page titles (more than 65 characters with spaces).</p>

  He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.

  Do not join independent clauses by a comma.
  Note that if the second clause is preceded by an adverb, such as accordingly, besides, so, then, therefore, or thus, and not by a conjunction, the semicolon is still required.
